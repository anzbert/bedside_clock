# Alarm Clock

## Background

The idea for this project started with my girlfriend buying a cheap ass bedside clock at Kmart. She quickly got annoyed with the room-illuminating brightness of the display at night, and there being no way to turn it down at all. On top of that, the clock broke after a few weeks.

Amazing! I happily jumped at the opportunity to use my growing collection of electronic parts and micro controllers! My plan was roughly to build a clock with some kind of dimmable display, a slappable arcade button on top for snoozing and a speaker for the alarm.
